# A Day In the Serverless Life

## Serverless Multicloud Development Workshop

This workshop is a series of hands-on modules which are designed to guide participants through the process of building cloud-native applications that expand across multiple clouds and platforms. The workshop provides experience using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat OpenShift Serverless (Knative and Camel K), and the AMQ streams technology in Red Hat AMQ and OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka.

### Audience

Developers, Architects, Data and Application Integrators

### Prerequisites

- AMQ Streams
- Application Interconnect (Skupper)
- Camel K
- OpenShift Serverless
- OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka
- OpenShift 4.x

### Duration

Each module should be able to be completed in between 60-90 minutes plus 20 mins of slides introducing the content.

### Provisioning Time

This workshop should be available after 60-75 minutes. It could fortuitously fail in the deployment, please just try again as it could be fixed already. If it takes more than 3 attempts, please do raise a ticket here: http://red.ht/rhpds-help 

Relevant information about the environment is sent in the final email.

## Workshop Modules 

This workshop is broken into 4 time-boxed modules:

Module 1: Provision a Managed Kafka cluster

Module 2: Serverless Integration with Camel K

Module 3: Data replication with Kafka

Module 4: Connecting applications across clouds

This workshop could also be split up. You can deliver module 2, 3, and 4 on their own, but module 2 and 3 have a hard dependency on cloud services meaning module 1 needs to be completed as a prerequisite. Module 4 can be delivered without prerequisites.
